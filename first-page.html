            <h1>Cryptocurrencies:</h1>
            <h2>Bitcoin:</h2>
                <p>
                    Bitcoin is a decentralized cryptocurrencie originally described in a 2008 whitepaper by a person,
                    or group of people, using the alias Satoshi Nakamoto. It was launched soon after, in January 2009.
                    <br><br>
                    Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer online currency, meaning that all transactions happen directly between equal,
                    independent network participants, without the need of any intermediary to permit or facilitate them. Bitcoin
                    was creater, according to Nakamoto's own words, to allow "online payments to be sent directly from one
                    party to another without going through a financial institution."
                    <br><br>
                    Some concepts for a similar type of decentralized electronic currency precede BTC, but Bitcoin holds the
                    distinction of being the first-ever cryptocurrency to come into actual use.
                </p>
            <h2>Ethereum:</h2>
                <p>
                    Ethereum is a decentralized open-source blockchain system that features its own cryptocurrency, Ether. ETH works as
                    a platform for numerous other cryptocurrencies, as well as for the execution of decentralized smart contracts.
                    <br><br>
                    Ethereum was first described in a 2013 whitepaper by Vitalik Buterin. Buterin, along with other co-founders, secured
                    funding for the project in an online public crowd sale in the summer of 2014. The project team managed to raise $18.3
                    million in Bitcoin, and Ethereum’s price in the Initial Coin Offering (ICO) was $0.311, with over 60 million Ether sold. Taking
                    Ethereum’s price now, this puts the return on investment (ROI) at an annualized rate of over 270%, essentially almost
                    quadrupling your investment every year since the summer of 2014.
                    <br><br>
                    The Ethereum Foundation officially launched the blockchain on July 30, 2015, under the prototype codenamed “Frontier.”
                    Since then, there has been several network updates — “Constantinople” on Feb. 28, 2019, “Istanbul” on Dec. 8, 2019, “Muir
                    Glacier” on Jan. 2, 2020, “Berlin” on April 14, 2021, and most recently on Aug. 5, 2021, the “London” hard fork.
                    <br><br>
                    Ethereum’s own purported goal is to become a global platform for decentralized applications, allowing users from all over
                    the world to write and run software that is resistant to censorship, downtime and fraud.

            <h2>Binance coin:</h2>
                <p>
                    Launched in July 2017, Binance is the biggest cryptocurrency exchange globally based on daily trading volume. Binance
                    aims to bring cryptocurrency exchanges to the forefront of financial activity globally. The idea behind Binance’s name is to
                    show this new paradigm in global finance — Binary Finance, or Binance.
                    <br><br>
                    Aside from being the largest cryptocurrency exchange globally, Binance has launched a whole ecosystem of functionalities
                    for its users. The Binance network includes the Binance Chain, Binance Smart Chain, Binance Academy, Trust Wallet and
                    Research projects, which all employ the powers of blockchain technology to bring new-age finance to the world. BNB is an
                    integral part of the successful functioning of many of the Binance sub-projects.
